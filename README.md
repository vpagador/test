Milestone 3

Created a class called `Hangman`. Inside the class, an `__init__` method was created to initialise the attributes of the class to pass in `word_list` and `num_lives` as           parameters. `num_lives` defaults to 5.

Attributes of the `Hangman` class:

  `word`: The word to be guessed, picked randomly from the word_list. Remember to import the random module into your script.
  
  `word_guessed`: list - A list of the letters of the word, with for each letter not yet guessed. For example, if the word is 'apple', the word_guessed list would be ['', '', '', '', '']. If the player guesses 'a', the list would be ['a', '', '', '', ''].
  
  `num_letters`: int - The number of UNIQUE letters in the word that have not been guessed yet.
  
  `num_lives`: int - The number of lives the player has at the start of the game.
  
  `word_list`: list - A list of words.
  
  `list_of_guesses`: list - A list of the guesses that have already been tried. Set this to an empty list initially.
  
  The `Hangman` class has two functions
